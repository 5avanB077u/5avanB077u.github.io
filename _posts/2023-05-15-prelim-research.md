## Potential Problem Statement and Experiment Design

From yesterday's research, I drafted the following (long-winded) problem statement/series of questions to guide my research: 
Is it important to diversify patients based on race in clinical trials to reflect the general population, or should patients be randomized and race considered irrelevant? Can AI or computer programs be used to recognize patterns in the responses of both clinical patients and post-market patients of a particular race in response to a certain drug to analyze whether the clinical trials had enough data from patients of certain backgrounds to predict their responses?


Possible experiment: 
1. Find datasets from various completed studies with a lack of diversity (how is this defined? What is the FDA requirement for diversity?)
2. Use AI to notice patterns in the response based on the results for clinical trials recorded (common side effects? Varying levels of efficacy?)
3. Repeat for post-market trials that tend to have a lot more participants and reflect the diversity of the general population
4. Answer the following questions: Was there correlation between race and respones? What may have caused it? Were the clinical trails indicative of this association? If not, do they need to be more diverse?
