## And...More Research Pt. 2

I've been looking into the angle of creating a "score" or some type of tool that scientists can use to determine whether their enrollment by race in a clinical trial is diverse enough, based on certain factors: 1) whether enough individuals of each race are enrolled to identify a pattern in their responses and 2) how much the drug-response determinant varies by race (after all, if the determinant doesn't vary at all and is standard among races, clinical diversity isn't as important). 

For 2), I'd probably need to train an AI model with a database of different drugs/how much the response to them varies by race, and then, based on a description of the new drug, the AI would identify which drug the new drug is most similar to and thus predict how much a patients' response will vary by race. 

To make this database, I was planning on comparing the data in Phase 3 and post-market trials from Phase 4 (from clinicaltrials.gov) to see if the varying racial breakdowns result in different primary or secondary outcomes.

However, this would probably take quite a lot of work, so I found this study that seems to have already done this with 6 years worth of clinical trials, so it might be easier to just use their dataset or look at their methodology as a reference: https://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpt.61. They also have an updated 2021 version of the study. 

My plan now is to reach out to the authors for access to their paper.
