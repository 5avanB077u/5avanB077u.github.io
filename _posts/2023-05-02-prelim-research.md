As a life update, I had spent the past few week preparing for my AP Chemistry, AP Calclulus BC, and AP Physics 1 exams coming up at the beginning of May, so I wasn't able to work as much on this project as much at that time. 

At this point, I decided to look at something completely different from combination therapy, because I was just getting into this field of pharmacy and drug development and wanted to explore my options for this research project--so I looked at racial diversity in clinical trials, which is a major issue. 

Clinical trials are mostly comprised on white patients, but that may affect how applicable the results of the clinical trials are to the drug's general target population, which is often much more racially diverse. And although race is a social construct, it is associated with differences in both intrinsic (genotypical) and extrinsic differences, which can lead to different drug responses and exposure times (how long and how much the drug remains in the bloodstream over time). 

I wasn't the only one concerned about the lack of clinical diversity in trials. The FDA published this draft guidance promoting diversity in trials (https://www.fda.gov/media/157635/download) to make results more generalizable. 

My thought process was that AI could be used to simulate the side effects in patients from those underrepresented groups to make up for a lack of data, or AI could find patterns in side effects in various racial/ethnic groups after trials have already been conducted.
