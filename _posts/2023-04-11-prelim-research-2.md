## Preliminary Research Pt. 2: Combination Therapy

With the goal of deciding a problem statement, I continued research. 

I watched a lecture called "The Challenge of Drug Development" from MIT (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZzB9qrPFzg) that gave me a good overview of the drug development process and which parts take the longest so I could attempt to shorten them. The main takeaways: 
1. Drug development is a long process that takes about 10 years, is costly, and has low probability of success. 
2. Comination therapy is putting multiple drugs together because they work better together. The most shocking part of this lecture was when Lo referenced biomedical experts that claimed we have all the drugs in the world needed to treat all diseases, and we don’t need to invent new ones; he added that the issue is testing all of them. 

This was shocking to me; if we already had all the drugs we needed to cure all the diseases, why were people wasting time creating new drugs? After talking to my mentor, though, I realized that Lo's statement was not entirely true, although combination therapy is definitely a valuable technique and could potentially be the focus of this project. 

Along that vein (no pun intended), I read an article from Tufts University (https://now.tufts.edu/2022/01/14/what-combination-drug-therapy) about comination therapy. 

It said that combination therapy helps treat infections where there are multiple pathogens or they are in different states. Multiple drugs working together, known as synergy, may help them boost each other’s efficacy, work more quickly, or require smaller doses of each drug. 

Fascinated by these positive outcomes, I drafted a potential problem statement: How can AI be used to simulate various combination therapies in the human body and narrow down those with high probability of success? 

I thought it could be interesting to use AI to either: 
1. Simulate various drug combinations and see which ones are most effective or
2. More specifically look at the side effects of different combinations and how they affect factors like drug resistance.
