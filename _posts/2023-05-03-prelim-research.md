## Preliminary Research Pt. 3 Discussion

At my meeting with my mentor today, we continued to explore possible problem statements, which could either be related to combination therapy or race in clinical trials. 
1. For combination therapy, a potential problem statement could be to prove (or disprove) Lo's statement that combination therapy could be used to address all the diseases in the world.
2. Regarding race in clinical trials, my mentor gave me a list of diseases and conditions that tend to vary by race: metabolism-related conditions, cardiovascular diseases, and rare diseases.

We continued looking at other questions to consider for the problem statement:  what part of the development stages are we targeting (preclinical, phase 1-4)? What drug class: A small molecule or large molecule? What is the motivation (exmples: using existing drugs present in developing nations, avoiding refrigeration of large molecule drugs)?
