## Preliminary Research Pt. 1: What is AI capable of? 

My project mentor from Analysis Group, who offers consulting services to drug development corporations, recommended integrating AI into this project because of the recent AI revolution in programs like ChatGPT. 

I decided to start of with some preliminary reserach on AI in drug development and came across this article (https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/02/15/1067904/ai-automation-drug-development/#:~:text=The%20vision%20is%20to%20use,need%20for%20painstaking%20lab%20work). The main takeaways were the following:
1. AI can work by detecting the small ways a sample of cells reacts to various drugs, so a scientist doesn’t have to administer treatment to the person and can instead predict their reaction to a drug by looking at microscale changes in a sample of their cells.
2. AI can accurately theorize how a drug will affect the human body and discards design that probably won’t work. This can accelerate the drug development process that on average takes 10 years and billions of dollars to develop.
3. AI can develop new drugs by identifying target pathogens or proteins in the pathogen (like spike protein on SARS-CoV-2) and design molecules to interact with the protein.

After a meeting with my mentor (we established a bikweekly meeting schedule), I learned that there are different types of drugs, including small molecules (often in the form of pills that you can take) and biological drugs (often in the form of injections, like cell therapy, mRNA vaccines, etc). 

From here, I decided to narrow down my problem statement by considering the following questions: What stage of drug development will I address--pre-clinical or clinical (testing in humans)? Will I work on a preventative vaccine or on treatment for diseases that have already manifested? And which type of drug (see above)? What exactly will the role of AI be?
