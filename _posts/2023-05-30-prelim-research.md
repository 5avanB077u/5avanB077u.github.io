## And...More Research

I used clinicaltrials.gov to search for trials "with results" that are "interventional," and noticed that many trials have breakdown of patients by race, but don't list results, symptoms, or anything else by race, so it's difficult to do analysis of the trials on my own. 

Other trials like this one already analyze results by race (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT00953667?term=response+by+race&rslt=With&type=Intr&draw=2&rank=3). 

Overall, though, since I want to see if trials are diverse enough by comparing the clinical trials to post-market results, I need more specific data (which my mentor said could be found in individual patient data files), or I need to find a study that has already done the analysis for me. 

I did more research on NIH, CDC, and WHO websites, but they don't seem to have what I'm looking for, so I need a different approach.
