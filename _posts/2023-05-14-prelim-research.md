## Potential Problem Statement

Since race itself is a social construct and drug responses and exposure can vary just as much within a race as it can between races, I wanted to be careful about my wording, so I read this article (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8604262/). The main takeaways: 
1. There is a difference between race (social construct) and biological ‘race’ (actual genetic differences in certain populations). 
2. It is heavily debated whether responses deviate based on ‘race.' However, my mentor said that most scientists will generally agree that it is important to diversity race in clinical trails becaomes may differ. 
3. BiDil is a historical example of a drug being more effective for African Americans (related to metabolism). 

I also looked at a paper referenced by the FDA draft guidance (in the previous post), which was cited as evidence of race causing different responses to drugs, used as the rationale for diversifying clinical trials: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/10847069_The_Importance_of_Race_and_Ethnic_Background_in_Biomedical_Research_and_Clinical_Practice. The main takeaways:
1. Low-frequency alleles are most likely to be predominantly present in one race because they typically descended from the same founders (endogamy). 
2. There are 5 main racial categories between which there is significant genetic variation: black or African American, white, Asian, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, and American Indian or Alaska Native.
3. Examples of genetics that tend to differ by race are hemochromatosis-associated mutant allele (C282Y) common in all European groups but not nonwhite groups, a variant of a cell receptor called CCR5-delta 32 that protects against HIV that many white people have, etc. 

I also now had a potential motivation: 
1. Currently, there is a lack of diverse patients in many clinical studies that may inhibit a thorough understanding of the response to a drug in patients of different backgrounds.
2. Results from this project may be used to recommend to researchers that they diversify populations/encourage minorities to participate in clinical studies for more data to identify patterns from.
