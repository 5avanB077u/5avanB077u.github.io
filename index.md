This is a personal blog to record my progress on a research project about diversifying race in clinical trials to ensure that they  can be used to understand the effect that a patient's race might have in their response to a certain drug.

I started this project (my first research project!) in March 2023, but only recently did I think of creating a blog about this instead of just writing everything on an unstructured Google Doc, so I can look back on it and see how much progress Iâ€™ve made and what I need to work on next.

Run by high school senior Savan Bollu. 

This blog was created with a template from https://chadbaldwin.net/2021/03/14/how-to-build-a-sql-blog.html.
